# CHIP-8 Emulator (C++)

# What is the Chip-8? and other questions
[See my Python emulator for more information.](https://github.com/sharifhsn/chip8-python-testing)

# Why C++?
I'm new to C++, and I thought that a good way to test my C++ chops was to port a project I had already created in a different language. Emulators are typically written in  low-level languages like C++, so it seemed most appropriate to port my CHIP-8 emulator.

# Usage
This project is as of yet still unusable, as input and output have not been implemented. Running the emulator only requires you to run the `chip8.exe` file.

# Future Development
Adding display output and key input are the most immediate features that will need to be added.
